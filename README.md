# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This repository contains my revision and practice work on **data visualization using Matplotlib** — one of the most powerful and widely used libraries in Python for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## 📊 Overview

In this notebook, I’ve explored the key concepts and functions of Matplotlib to better understand how data can be represented visually.
The goal of this work is to strengthen my foundation in **data visualization**, which is an essential part of the Data Science and AI workflow.
